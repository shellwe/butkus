    <h2>“First, do no harm”</h2>
    <p>Our primary focus is on trying to not lose money. If an investor is daydreaming about a ten-fold return from a stock, that investor is unrealistically and dangerously focused. We believe that it is more profitable in the long term to consider risk as the most important component of investing and if portfolio management is approached this way that reward will follow. Furthermore, we believe that as fiduciaries to our clients, we should manage their money using an aversion to loss as our guide, not greed.</p>

        <td width="293" height="907" valign="top"><p><span class="boldgreen">We are medium to long-term</span> investors and we manage stock portfolios for individuals, retirement plans and trusts.</p>
          <p><span class="boldgreen">We specialize</span> in researching and choosing individual stocks and we diversify your stock portfolio by selecting 20 to 30 companies among as many industries as possible.<br />
            <br />
            <span class="boldgreen">We do our own research</span> and while we may integrate various parties&#8217; research into our thinking, we do not base our conclusions on anyone&#8217;s thinking other than our own.<br />
            <br />
            <span class="boldgreen">We find</span> companies with low or no debt, consistently positive free cash flow, a good dividend, excellent management in promising industries, and a potential positive catalyst in the offing.<br />
            <br />
            <span class="boldgreen">We are extremely price sensitive</span> about when we buy a stock, often &#8220;lying in wait&#8221; for  months or possibly years before taking a position at our target price. Then if a stock moves up, sometimes even just 10-20%, we often stop buying.<br />
            <br />
            <span class="boldgreen">We &#8220;eat our own               cooking&#8221;</span> and very often invest in what we buy for clients, while making sure our clients receive the best possible trade executions.<br />
            <br />
            <span class="boldgreen">We are conservative</span> , highly focused and no-nonsense in our approach, yet we think we are very friendly and we love to treat people like they are our only client.<br />
            <br />
            <span class="boldgreen">We understand</span> that stocks may not be appropriate for all of an investor&#8217;s money and we invest according to each individual investor&#8217;s needs, situation and outlook. Very often a portfolio of U.S. Government agency bonds, F.D.I.C. insured Certificates of Deposit or tax-free municipal bonds are recommended to clients for whom they are indicated, in addition to a portfolio of  income stocks.&nbsp; However, we do not accept accounts that are comprised of only bonds, as we are primarily stock portfolio managers.</p></td>
        <td width="292" valign="top"><p><span class="boldgreen">We do not attempt to be world beaters. </span>Those who do often stub their toe.  We think that a very reasonable way to invest is to target an annual  total return around 8%.&nbsp; Combined with cautious, wary and loss-averse stock picking, this conservative target often results in fewer losing stock positions.&nbsp; And having fewer losing positions means having more winning ones:  <em>&quot;First, do no harm&quot;</em> --- we try to &quot;win by not losing&quot;. Unfortunately, we feel that this utterly elemental yet extremely critical concept is lost on many investors in the more pleasurable focus on how high a stock might go, rather than how low. A ten pound trout reaches that size by making darn sure what he picks up to eat is food, not a hook.
          </p>
          <p><span class="boldgreen">We are not hobbyists.</span> Investing in stocks is our passion, pure and simple.  We take investing your money very seriously but               get our &#8220;kicks&#8221; out of correctly analyzing, carefully buying, and reluctantly selling stocks at the right time. Investing  is not a part-time endeavor. Those who want to be hobbyist investors would be happiest at an online trading firm. We don&#8217;t feel investing is a bona fide hobby or an end in itself, rather, it is ultimately a  means to greater personal freedom and peace of mind. We invest only for people who need us to help them and who can see the value of having a professional investor manage their stock portfolio. Our &quot;Core Client Composite&quot; investment performance is available on request.<br />
