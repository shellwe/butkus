    <h2>It’s easy to do business with us.</h2>
    <p>We largely serve individuals and we are very approachable. Call us anytime at (402) 558-7774 or (800) 293-5916 to ask questions or set up an appointment.<br />
    E-mail us: mike@butkus.com will go directly to the desktop of Mike Butkus.<br />
    Drop in. We are located at 6401 Pacific Street (on the corner of 64th Ave. and Pacific) in Omaha, overlooking the Elmwood Park Golf Course.</p>
    <h2> To open an account with Michael J. Butkus &amp; Company:</h2>
    <p>Clients sign a new account form, an advisory agreement and an account transfer form (if applicable). Retirement accounts also require an “adoption agreement” and a designation of a beneficiary form.  Furthermore, all clients are asked to fill out a five page questionnaire which describes your needs, desires, and risk tolerance to us. Once these forms are returned, your account will be opened and we will begin investing on your behalf.</p>

        <td width="325" height="598" valign="top"><h2>Lower fees than the average equity mutual fund</h2>
          <p>We charge flat annual fees, billed quarterly based on the amount and type of assets in your account.  Equity accounts  pay an annual fee of 1.0 % of assets. We have a $100,000 minimum account size at Michael J. Butkus &amp; Company for a very practical reason: diversification. We have found that adequate diversification helps to greatly reduce volatility and risk in portfolios. It is difficult to diversify a smaller account adequately and manage it economically, and investment performance may suffer as a result.</p>
          <h2>Very low fixed income fee</h2>
          <p>The above is our fee schedule for stocks. However, on the fixed income portion of your portfolio, we charge a management fee of just 2/10th's of 1% (.2%).  Simply stated, there isn't as much expertise required to manage fixed income investments, so we only charge this rather nominal fee to cover costs.  This is a real departure from many investment firms and can have the effect of lowering your overall portfolio management fees. This investment category includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. Government Agency Securities, FDIC-insured Certificates of Deposit, Tax-free Municipal Bonds and Corporate Bonds.</p></td>
        <td width="325" valign="top"><p>Your assets are held at the brokerage firm of           Raymond James and Associates, Inc.  and you           receive your monthly statement and trade confirmations from them. Raymond           James is a 50 year-old investment firm and its parent company, Raymond           James Financial Services, Inc.  is one of the larger           financial services firms in the            United States           . To make           the distinction once again, Raymond James is the brokerage firm at           which your assets are held and Butkus &amp; Company manages these assets as your investment adviser. <em>You are not charged commissions</em> by the brokerage firm, only an asset-based fee by Butkus &amp; Company. Our office will also provide periodic performance updates and we will meet with you to review your account at the intervals you choose. <br />
          </p>
          <h2>Very important:</h2>
          <p>You can easily follow your account on the internet,         securely and virtually real time, directly from the Raymond James         website. Once your account is set up you create your own password and         can then access your account any time. We strongly recommend that you do this.<br />
